Task-oriented guide for navigating and interacting with the application using keyboard shortcuts.

## Use keyboard shortcuts during review sessions

**Goal:** Speed up your review flow without using a mouse.

The review page supports keyboard shortcuts for all common actions:

| Key | Action | When Available |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| `Space` | Show answer | While viewing question |
| `1` | Rate "Again" | After answer revealed |
| `2` | Rate "Hard" | After answer revealed |
| `3` | Rate "Good" | After answer revealed |
| `4` | Rate "Easy" | After answer revealed |

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to **Review** page
2. Read the question displayed on the card
3. Press **Spacebar** to reveal the answer
4. Press **1**, **2**, **3**, or **4** to rate your recall

The next card loads immediately after rating.

**Note:** Keyboard shortcuts only work when focus is not in an input field. Click outside any text input to restore shortcut functionality.

## Skip to main content

**Goal:** Quickly bypass navigation to access page content.

The application includes an accessibility skip link:

1. When any page loads, press **Tab** once
2. The "Skip to main content" link becomes visible
3. Press **Enter** to jump directly to the main content area

This feature helps keyboard users navigate efficiently without tabbing through the entire sidebar.

## Navigate with keyboard only

**Goal:** Use the application without a mouse.

The entire application supports keyboard navigation:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Move focus to next interactive element |
| `Shift + Tab` | Move focus to previous element |
| `Enter` | Activate focused button or link |
| `Escape` | Close modals, dismiss notifications |
| `Arrow keys` | Navigate within menus and lists |

**Focus indicators:** All interactive elements display a visible focus ring when selected via keyboard.

## Dismiss notifications with keyboard

**Goal:** Close toast notifications without clicking.

When a notification appears:

1. For error notifications, focus automatically moves to the close button
2. Press **Escape** to dismiss any visible notification
3. Alternatively, press **Tab** to reach the close button, then **Enter**

Notifications auto-dismiss after 3 seconds, so keyboard dismissal is optional.

## Navigate modals with keyboard

**Goal:** Complete modal forms and dialogs using keyboard only.

When a modal opens (e.g., Create Concept):

1. Focus is trapped within the modal
2. Press **Tab** to move between form fields and buttons
3. Press **Escape** to close the modal without saving
4. Press **Enter** when focused on the submit button to save

**Focus trap:** While a modal is open, Tab cycling is limited to elements within the modal. This prevents accidentally interacting with background content.

## Rating guidelines for keyboard users

**Goal:** Understand which rating key to press.

| Rating | Key | Use When |
|--------|-----|----------|
| Again | `1` | Completely forgot, need to see again soon |
| Hard | `2` | Remembered with significant difficulty |
| Good | `3` | Remembered correctly with some effort |
| Easy | `4` | Recalled instantly, felt too easy |

**Tip:** If unsure, press `3` (Good). It is the most common rating and keeps the spacing algorithm working effectively.

## Keyboard shortcut hints

**Goal:** Discover available shortcuts while using the app.

The review page displays keyboard hints below each rating button:

- "Again (Press 1)"
- "Hard (Press 2)"
- "Good (Press 3)"
- "Easy (Press 4)"

These hints remind you of available shortcuts during review sessions.
