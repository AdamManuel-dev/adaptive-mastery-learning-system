## What You Will Learn

The Adaptive Mastery Learning System tracks your performance across six cognitive dimensions. This tutorial teaches you to read your mastery profile and use it to improve your learning strategy.

---

## Step 1: Set Up Test Content

Before exploring mastery tracking, you need concepts with multiple card types. Let's create three concepts to generate diverse review cards.

### Create Concept 1: Mitosis

Navigate to **Concepts** and click **Add Concept**.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | `Mitosis` |
| **Definition** | `Cell division that produces two genetically identical daughter cells from a single parent cell` |

Click **Create**.

### Create Concept 2: Meiosis

Click **Add Concept** again.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | `Meiosis` |
| **Definition** | `Cell division that reduces chromosome number by half, producing four haploid gametes from one diploid cell` |

Click **Create**.

### Create Concept 3: DNA Replication

Click **Add Concept** one more time.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | `DNA Replication` |
| **Definition** | `The process by which DNA makes an identical copy of itself during cell division` |

Click **Create**.

**Verification checkpoint:** The Concepts page shows 4 concept cards (including Photosynthesis from the Getting Started tutorial).

---

## Step 2: Complete 10 Card Reviews

Navigate to **Dashboard** and click **Start Review Session**.

For this tutorial, rate cards using varied ratings to create a realistic mastery profile:

| Card Number | Suggested Rating | Why |
|-------------|-----------------|-----|
| 1 | Good (3) | Standard correct answer |
| 2 | Easy (4) | You knew it instantly |
| 3 | Hard (2) | Took effort to recall |
| 4 | Good (3) | Standard correct answer |
| 5 | Again (1) | Practice handling mistakes |
| 6 | Good (3) | Standard correct answer |
| 7 | Hard (2) | Some difficulty |
| 8 | Easy (4) | Quick recall |
| 9 | Good (3) | Standard correct answer |
| 10 | Good (3) | Standard correct answer |

As you review each card, notice:
- The **dimension badge** on each card (e.g., "definition", "paraphrase", "example")
- The **concept name** to know which topic you're testing
- Your **response time** is being tracked (shown implicitly through the timer)

**Verification checkpoint:** Complete at least 10 reviews. If you run out of cards, wait a few minutes for more to become due, or create additional concepts.

---

## Step 3: Navigate to the Dashboard

After completing reviews, return to the Dashboard.

Click **Dashboard** in the sidebar (or click the "Exit Review" link if still in review mode).

---

## Step 4: Locate the Mastery by Dimension Section

Scroll down to find the **Mastery by Dimension** section.

**Verification checkpoint:** You see:
- A section header: "Mastery by Dimension"
- Multiple dimension rows with progress bars
- A warning banner if any dimension is particularly weak

---

## Step 5: Read the Dimension Bars

Each dimension shows three pieces of information:

```
Definition                                    85%
[================------------]
3 reviews
```

| Element | What It Means |
|---------|--------------|
| **Dimension name** | The type of knowledge being tested |
| **Percentage** | Your current mastery level (0-100%) |
| **Progress bar** | Visual representation of mastery |
| **Review count** | Number of times you've answered this dimension |

### The Six Dimensions Explained

| Dimension | What It Tests |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Definition** | Can you recall the definition when shown the term? |
| **Paraphrase** | Can you recognize correct restatements in different words? |
| **Example** | Can you identify correct and incorrect examples? |
| **Scenario** | Can you apply the concept to new situations? |
| **Discrimination** | Can you distinguish similar concepts? |
| **Cloze** | Can you fill in missing key terms? |

---

## Step 6: Interpret Your Mastery Levels

Use this guide to understand your scores:

| Score Range | Meaning | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| **85-100%** | Strong mastery | Maintenance reviews only |
| **70-84%** | Good understanding | Continue regular practice |
| **55-69%** | Developing knowledge | Focus attention here |
| **Below 55%** | Needs work | Prioritize this dimension |

**Example interpretation:**

```
Your Mastery Profile
-------------------------------------
Definition        85%   [Strong]
Paraphrase        72%   [Good]
Example           68%   [Developing]
Scenario          45%   [Needs work] <- Focus here
Discrimination    58%   [Developing]
Cloze             78%   [Good]
```

This profile indicates strong definition recall but weakness in applying concepts to scenarios.

---

## Step 7: Identify Your Weakest Dimension

Look for the **"Needs Work"** badge on the Dashboard.

![Screenshot placeholder: Weak dimension highlighted with warning badge](./images/weak-dimension.png)

The system automatically identifies your weakest dimension and displays:
- A warning icon/banner at the top of the Mastery section
- The text: "Focus area: **[Dimension Name]** needs more practice"
- A "Needs Work" badge next to the dimension name

**Verification checkpoint:** Note which dimension has the lowest percentage or the "Needs Work" badge. Write it down:

My weakest dimension is: ________________

---

## Step 8: Understand What the System Does Next

The adaptive system uses your mastery profile to select future cards. Here's what happens:

### Automatic Weakness Targeting

When you start your next review session, the system will:

1. **Prioritize weak dimensions**: Cards testing your weak areas appear more often
2. **Maintain strong dimensions**: You'll still see occasional cards for strong areas (20% of session)
3. **Prevent frustration**: After 3 consecutive failures, easier cards appear
4. **Cap single-dimension focus**: No more than 70% of cards from one dimension

### The Selection Formula

```
Card Priority = Base Weight x Weakness Boost x Novelty Factor

Where:
- Weakness Boost is higher for low-mastery dimensions
- Novelty Factor prefers cards you haven't seen recently
```

---

## Step 9: Practice Your Weak Dimension

Return to review to experience targeted practice.

Click **Start Review Session** on the Dashboard.

As you review, notice:
- More cards appear from your weak dimension(s)
- The "Focus: [dimension]" indicator shows why each card was selected
- Your mastery percentage increases with correct answers

**Exercise:** Complete 5 more reviews and observe:

| After Review | Look For |
|--------------|----------|
| Review 1 | What dimension is the card testing? |
| Review 2 | Is it targeting your weak area? |
| Review 3 | How does the difficulty feel? |
| Review 4 | Notice the time tracking |
| Review 5 | Check the progress bar movement |

---

## Step 10: Verify Mastery Improvement

Return to the Dashboard after completing reviews.

**Verification checkpoint:** Compare your mastery profile to before:
- Your weak dimension percentage should have increased
- The overall mastery score should be higher
- Review counts should be updated

## Congratulations!

You now understand how to read and use your mastery profile:

1. Located the Mastery by Dimension section
2. Interpreted dimension bars and percentages
3. Identified weak areas needing attention
4. Experienced the adaptive card selection
5. Verified improvement through targeted practice

---

## Key Takeaways

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Six Dimensions** | Definition, Paraphrase, Example, Scenario, Discrimination, Cloze |
| **Mastery Range** | 0-100% based on accuracy and speed |
| **Weakness Threshold** | Below 70% triggers increased focus |
| **Adaptive Selection** | System automatically prioritizes weak areas |
| **Anti-Frustration** | System backs off after repeated failures |

---

## What's Different About This System

Traditional flashcard apps treat all correct answers the same. This system recognizes that:

| Traditional SRS | Adaptive Mastery System |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| "You got it right, moving on" | "You're strong on definitions but weak on application" |
| Tests one way per card | Tests six cognitive dimensions |
| Same schedule for all | Prioritizes your weak areas |
| Binary correct/incorrect | Tracks accuracy AND speed |

---

## Next Steps

| Activity | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Add 5 more concepts | Build a larger card pool for better adaptation |
| Review daily for a week | See long-term mastery trends |
| Try different rating strategies | Learn how ratings affect scheduling |
| Explore the Settings page | Customize session length and other preferences |

## Quick Reference: Dimension Guide

| Dimension | Question Format | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Definition | "What is X?" | "What is mitosis?" |
| Paraphrase | "Which means the same?" | "Which describes cell splitting?" |
| Example | "Is this an example of X?" | "Is cancer cell growth mitosis?" |
| Scenario | "What concept applies here?" | "A wound healing uses which process?" |
| Discrimination | "What's the difference?" | "Mitosis vs meiosis?" |
| Cloze | "Fill in the blank" | "Mitosis produces ___ daughter cells" |

## Troubleshooting

### All dimensions show the same percentage

**Problem:** Every dimension shows identical mastery (e.g., all at 50%).

**Cause:** You haven't reviewed enough cards across different dimensions.

**Solution:** Continue reviewing. Mastery scores diverge as you review more cards and the system learns your strengths and weaknesses.

### No weak dimension identified

**Problem:** Dashboard doesn't show any "Needs Work" badge.

**Cause:** All dimensions are above the weakness threshold (70%) or insufficient review data.

**Solution:** This is good! It means you're performing well across all dimensions. Continue regular practice to maintain your skills.

### Mastery percentage seems wrong

**Problem:** You rated everything "Good" but mastery is low.

**Cause:** Speed also affects mastery. Taking longer to answer reduces your speed score.

**Solution:** The formula is: `Mastery = 70% accuracy + 30% speed`. Practice for both accuracy and speed.
